# Experimet 4
## Aim of the Experiment
Write a C program to implement Dijsktra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path through a network.

### Steps or Procedure of experiment
Dijsktra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph.

### Algorithm
1.Create cost matrix C[ ][ ] from adjacency matrix adj[ ][ ]. C[i][j] is the cost of going from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge between vertices i and j then C[i][j] is infinity.

2.Array visited[ ] is initialized to zero.

for(i=0;i<n;i++)

visited[i]=0;

3.If the vertex 0 is the source vertex then visited[0] is marked as 1.

4.Create the distance matrix, by storing the cost of vertices from vertex no. 0 to n-1 from the source vertex 0.

for (i=1; i<n;i++)

distance[i]=cost[0][i];

Initially, distance of source vertex is taken as 0. i.e. distance[0]=0;

5.for(i=1;i<n;i++)

– Choose a vertex w, such that distance[w] is minimum and visited[w] is 0. Mark visited[w] as 1.

– Recalculate the shortest distance of remaining vertices from the source.

– Only, the vertices not marked as 1 in array visited[ ] should be considered for recalculation of distance. i.e. for each vertex v

if(visited[v]==0)

distance[v]=min(distance[v],

distance[w]+cost[w][v])
